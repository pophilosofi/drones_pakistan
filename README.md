Sentiment and Discrete Emotion Analysis of the Impact of Drone Warfare on Pakistani Civilians

The present research sets out to answer the question "What is the emotional impact of automated warfare on civilians?". This research will centre on the case of the drone war waged by the United States against Pakistan between 2004 and 2018 to highlight the psychological effects of automated warfare on people.
To do this, a brand-new dataset was constructed. The constitutes of tweets linked to individual drone strikes that were written by Pakistani citizens. We then ran sentiment and discrete emotion analysis on the aforementioned dataset.
The latest data casts doubt on the assumption that the majority of Pakistanis see the use of drones as a counterterrorism measure.
According to the research, drones have a detrimental effect on social structures, particularly tribal ones, and this perception of the US as a common adversary among civilians hurts efforts to fight terrorism.
